# danielcbaldwin dotfiles

## install

- `git clone --recursive git://github.com/joshuamorris3/dotfiles ~/.dotfiles`
- `cd ~/.dotfiles`
- `./setup.sh`

The install rake task will symlink the appropriate files in `.dotfiles` to your
home directory. Everything is configured and tweaked within `~/.dotfiles`,
though.
